## What is ComfyGit?

ComfyGit brings real version control to ComfyUI. Create isolated environments for different projects, track every change with git, and switch between complete setups instantly. Share your exact configuration with others — workflows, models, nodes, and all.

ComfyGit Manager is the visual control panel that lives inside ComfyUI, giving you point-and-click access to everything ComfyGit can do.

## Features

### Environment Management
Switch between completely isolated ComfyUI setups in seconds. Each environment has its own workflows, custom nodes, and model configurations.
