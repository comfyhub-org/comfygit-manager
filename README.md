## What is ComfyGit?

ComfyGit brings real version control to ComfyUI. Create isolated environments for different projects, track every change with git, and switch between complete setups instantly. Share your exact configuration with others — workflows, models, nodes, and all.

ComfyGit Manager is the visual control panel that lives inside ComfyUI, giving you point-and-click access to everything ComfyGit can do.

## Features

### Environment Management
Switch between completely isolated ComfyUI setups in seconds. Each environment has its own workflows, custom nodes, and model configurations.

### Workflow Resolution
Open a workflow with missing models or nodes? The resolution wizard finds what you need and installs it automatically.

### One-Click Imports
Import complete ComfyUI environments from git URLs or archives. Get up and running with someone else's exact setup instantly.

### Git Integration
Full branch management, commit history, and remote sync — all from a visual interface. No command line required.

### Status Dashboard
See everything at a glance: uncommitted changes, sync status, missing dependencies, and environment health.

### First-Time Wizard
New to ComfyGit? The setup wizard guides you through creating your first workspace and environment.
